# STMDomingoArkanoid
##Description
DomingoArkanoid is a simple 2D action game for one player written in C++ for Windows.
The paddle can be controled by keyboard or accelerometer in STM32F407 Discovery.

##Tools
CooCox CoIDE v1.7.8, 
Visual Studio 2015, 
SDL 1.0 

##What've done
Paddle and ball with stable speed. Breakable tiles. Two levels of game, random set
of tiles. Possibility to use STM32F407 Discovery as keyboard (gamepad isn't working with SDL 1.0).

##What we've to do
Bonuses: revert paddle direction, change ball speed, shooting, lengthen or reduce length of paddle.
Rewrite project to SDL 2.0, to make it compatibile with gamepads.
